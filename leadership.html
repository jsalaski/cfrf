					<h3>Kelly McLain</h3>
					<p class = "pBlack"><strong>Adviser, Founder</strong>
						<br>
						<br>
						As a mother of an adult son who has cystic fibrosis Kelly knows first-hand how difficult it can be to manage the CF journey.  When she learned in 2009 that approximately 20% of the adult CF population were losing their battle with this disease because they could not afford to purchase enough food she knew something needed to be done to tackle this problem. With compassion in her heart and a prayer on her lips she vowed to do something and the Cystic Fibrosis Relief Fund became a reality.  After serving as the  organization’s Executive Director from 2009 through 2018, Kelly decided to step back in 2019 and now serves as an adviser to the board of directors.
						<br>
						<br>
						​​Professionally, Kelly received the KTTC TV’s “10 Who Make a Difference Award” for her work supporting people with cystic fibrosis. She has worked in office management for over two decades as well as medical reception in two medical clinics, including the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.  She’s also owned and managed two successful home businesses. She resides in Byron, Minnesota with her husband Larry.</p>
